    <abstract>
      <t>
      In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for recording and 
      collecting operational and telemetry information while the packet traverses a path 
      between two points in the network. This document defines a type of IOAM Node Data that 
      makes use of the Node Data Fields to help an opoerator gain visibility on 
      environmental sustainability information on the Internet by providing per-hop 
      (i.e., per topological network node) power metrics and other current or future 
      sustainability metrics. This will contribute to achieving an objective mentioned 
      in the IAB E-Impact workshop.
      </t>
      <t>
      The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional setting, but also in a 
      scheduled automated setting where they may be run periodically in a mesh across an 
      administrative domain to map out environmental-impact metrics.

      <t>
        In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) <xref target="RFC9197" /> 
        collects operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
        traverses a path between two points in the network.  The term "in situ" 
        refers to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets 
        rather than being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.
        IOAM is used to complement mechanisms, such as Ping or Traceroute.
      </t>
      <t>
        As the world transitions towards sustainability in technology, the focus 
        is shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused with 
        sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are already 
        available, to enhance visibility, measurement, and quantification of 
        their impact. Consequently, tools which have been foundational 
        for control and management for decades now encounter new 
        requirements including enhancing them to cater to a significantly 
        increasing demand for monitoring the sustainability and environmental 
        impact. This document serves that need by defining an IOAM Node Data 
        that uses the Node Data Fields to gain visibility on environmental 
        sustainability information
      </t>
      <t>
        By using the combination of IOAM Data Fields, a device can explicitly add
        these exemplary environmental sustainability metrics for transmission 
        across an administrative domain:
      </t>
      
      <?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
        <ul>
          <li>Present and idle power (node level, component level)</li>
          <li>Throughput (node level, component level)</li>
          <li>Throughput (node level, component level)</li>
        </ul>
      <?rfc subcompact="no" ?>

      <t>
        Additional environmental sustainability metrics, such as the following, for 
        example, may also be specified in the future:
      </t>
      <?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical Energy Provider or Zone</li>
        <li>Geolocation</li>
      </ul>
