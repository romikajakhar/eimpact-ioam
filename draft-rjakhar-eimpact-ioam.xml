    <abstract>
      <t>
      This document defines a data structure that can be appended to selected
      IOAM messages. The IOAM extension defined herein can be used to
      gain visibility on environmental impact information on the Internet by providing
      per-hop (i.e., per topological network node) power metrics
      and other current or future sustainability metrics. This will contribute to achieving
      an objective mentioned in the IAB E-Impact workshop.
      </t>
      <t>
      The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping request), but also in a scheduled automated 
      setting where they may be run periodically in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out environmental-impact metrics.

        In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) <xref target="RFC9197" /> 
        collects operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
        traverses a path between two points in the network.  The term "in situ" 
        refers to the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets 
        rather than being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.
        IOAM is used to complement mechanisms, such as Ping or Traceroute.
      </t>
      <t>
        As the world transitions towards sustainability in technology, the focus 
        is shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused with 
        sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are already 
        available, to enhance visibility, measurement, and quantification of 
        their impact. Consequently, tools which have been foundational 
        for control and management for decades now encounter new 
        requirements including enhancing them to cater to a significantly 
        increasing demand for monitoring the sustainability and environmental 
        impact. This document serves that need by defining an IOAM extension 
        object that appends environmental impact information to IOAM messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        Using the extension defined herein, a device can explicitly append
        these exemplary environmental impact metrics for transmission across an 
        administrative domain:
