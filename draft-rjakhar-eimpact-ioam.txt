             IOAM Extensions for Environmental Information
                     draft-rjakhar-eimpact-ioam-00

Abstract

   In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
   for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information
   while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.
   This document defines a type of IOAM Node Data that makes use of the
   Node Data Fields to help an opoerator gain visibility on
   environmental sustainability information on the Internet by providing
   per-hop (i.e., per topological network node) power metrics and other
   current or future sustainability metrics.  This will contribute to
   achieving an objective mentioned in the IAB E-Impact workshop.

   The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional
   setting, but also in a scheduled automated setting where they may be
   run periodically in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out
   environmental-impact metrics.

1.  Introduction

   In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) [RFC9197]
   collects operational and telemetry information in the packet while
   the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  The
   term "in situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data is added to the
   data packets rather than being sent within packets specifically
   dedicated to OAM.  IOAM is used to complement mechanisms, such as
   Ping or Traceroute.

   As the world transitions towards sustainability in technology, the
   focus is shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused
   with sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are
   already available, to enhance visibility, measurement, and
   quantification of their impact.  Consequently, tools which have been
   foundational for control and management for decades now encounter new
   requirements including enhancing them to cater to a significantly
   increasing demand for monitoring the sustainability and environmental
   impact.  This document serves that need by defining an IOAM Node Data
   that uses the Node Data Fields to gain visibility on environmental
   sustainability information

   By using the combination of IOAM Data Fields, a device can explicitly
   add these exemplary environmental sustainability metrics for
   transmission across an administrative domain:

   *  Present and idle power (node level, component level)

   *  Throughput (node level, component level)

   *  Throughput (node level, component level)

   Additional environmental sustainability metrics, such as the
   following, for example, may also be specified in the future:

   *  Electrical Energy Provider or Zone

   *  Geolocation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
